# ML-CardioVascular-Classification-Project
#Project Summary
I have been given a data-set of cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.The dataset contains 3390 rows and 17 features.The dataset doesn't contains any duplicate values but there are many features that contains null values but the percentage of null values is very small and it can be adjusted.The features in the datatset gives us information about the patient like what is the age,education,sex of patient and information like whether the patient is smoker or not if yes then how many cigrates he/she smokes per day and health related information whether the patient is taking any BPmed or not, what is his/her cholestrol level,is he/she diabetic or not,what is his/her BP,BMI,glucose level and heartrate.Using all this information I have to build a model that can predict what are the chances that the patient is at risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease in next 10 years.

First of all i treated all the null values present in my datatset with median/mode based on the distribution of that feature and then i distinguish all the features into categorical,discrete,and contionous and the data also contains some outliers but since it is a health related problem and we have small dataset also, so i am not going to treat the outliers as it might be containing some useful information

After cleaning the data i performed EDA (univeriate,Biveriate and Multiveriate analysis), in order to extract some useful insights from the data.Then i performed Feature Enginering and data preprocessing in which i performed label encoding for categirical features and defined some new features like pulse_pressure,smoking_status,and Diabetic_status and then i calculated VIF to find out Multicolinearity between the features and selected important feature for futher analysis.

Since the data is very imbalanced SMOTE(over-sampling) was used to deal with that

After spilliting the data in train and test ,i transformed the data using standard scaler and then i oversampled the data in order to balance it and then i implemented different model on the data like Logistic Regression,KNN,Random Forest,Naive Bayes,XGBoost with accuracy,pression,recall,F1-score and AUC as evaluation metrices.Among all the model XGBosst model performed very well with GridSearch CV as hyperparameter Tunning on both training and test data samples and this model was choosed as final model.
